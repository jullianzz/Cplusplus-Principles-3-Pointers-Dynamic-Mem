ReverseMultiply doubles the size of an integer array and fills the second half
with a copy of the first half in reverse order and adds a final additional location for the product of all the
numbers.

ReverseAdd creates an array with the original values and then adds new entries
that are the sum of sets of numbers in the array starting from the original “end” moving forward.
